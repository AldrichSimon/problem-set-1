# Problem Set 1: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations

In this problem set, you will practice the concepts we've learned about variables, data types, and operations.

You can reference the [related lecture content](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2024/course-materials/tree/main/slides#variables-data-types-and-basic-operations-sep-3) when completing the problem set. 

**CLOS**: This assignment builds toward [Course Learning Outcomes](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-spring-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#learning-outcomes) SP.1 (applying Python principles) 

To receive a **satisfactory** grade on this assignment, you must get at least 8 /11 problems correct. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Late work will not be accepted unless you [apply a token](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWGANcOn9VWNimdhsPJpz-3gQsxg-hhSbGuHHHsBFHMZ2fVA/viewform?usp=sf_link) at least 24 hours before the deadline. <br/><br/>
> Do not change the text inside the red comments from the starter code (e.g. `'''PROBLEM 1'''`, `'''END PROBLEM 1'''`). If you change these, the grader won't run correctly. 

> [!TIP]
> Doing one problem incorrectly might prevent other problems from rendering. If you can't solve one problem and want to move onto the next, you can comment out your current problem so it doesn't affect the code below. 

## Instructions 

1. Find the starter code [here](https://trinket.io/python/361459682c).

2. Create your own copy of the trinket by clicking the **"remix"** button above the right side of the editor <img width="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-spring-2024/online-platforms/assets/8368413/34200f30-4d43-41fa-a95a-bcab84d0e997">

3. Complete the first problem by following the directions in the green comments from the starter code. 

5. Hit **"save"** icon <img width="73" alt="image" src="https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-spring-2024/online-platforms/assets/8368413/3aa4142c-1b4e-4b44-8dff-fb295d2a19f9"> (to the left of the remix button)

6. Hit the share button toward the left side above the editor, then hit link. Copy the URL and paste it into the `trinket.md` file from this repo. 

7. Continue completing the rest of the problems. Save often! 

8. Saving in Trinket will not trigger the grader in GitHub. You can re-run the grader as you complete the problem set two ways:

  - Make an innocuous change to the `trinket.md` file (like adding a space). Any changes you commit will trigger the grader. 

  - Go to the **Actions** tab of this repo. From the **All workflows** drop down select, **Display Gatorgrade** and then **Run Workflow**. 

9. The grader will run again automatically a few minutes after the pass deadline. Don't make any changes to your trinket once you have solved all problems. (Instead, you can make a copy of it and experiment with that.) 

> [!WARNING]
>
> By default, GatorGrade will send an build fail to your email whenever you make an assignment submission with missing checks, even if you are still working on it! You can update build notifications by going to [this link](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and scrolling down to System>Actions.
